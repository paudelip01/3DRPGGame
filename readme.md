The game development project that I have created is a simple 3D RPG combat game which provides an easy gaming experience to the player. It is a simple game in which the player objective is to survive themselves in an island and reach the final destination with the health they are provided with. The game is provided with the assets of Nepal to give a Nepali feel to the game. The various requirements of the project are Input keys, Equipment of the weapon, Enemies attacking player, User interface,Proper designing of the map, Animation of the different characters.
